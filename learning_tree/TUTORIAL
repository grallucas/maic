Copy the TEMPLATE file and use that for the node structure

The naming structure is 'name-name-name-nodeid-childrenid(s)'
^ as many names as you would like, just for 'name' do not have numbers in it.
The name is purely for file organization and has no use.
Node id is a single int and children id are all seperated by '-'

ex 'what-is-ai-3-2-1' where 'what is ai' is the name, '3' is the nodeid and [2,1] are the parents 


Minor tips
    Inputted 'horizontal_displacement' in the root node (node_id=1) is not used. 
    It is always set to 0,0 for consistency

    Horizontal displacement is how many pixels left (negative) or right (positive)
    you want the node to be from the average x position of the parent node(s)
