Problem​

- Researching through the Academic Catalog is tedious when wanting to find information about the university​

Approach​

- Using a transformer to “learn” the catalog and be able to answer questions about the university and courses​

Progress​

- Currently working on a proof-of-concept LSTM model with the SQUAD dataset​
