## Why Read?

You may already be familiar with the Rosie Dashboard, but it's also possible to connect to Rosie with a command line. In fact, sometimes it's easier or necessary to do so. The terminal is your friend if: the Rosie dashboard is down, you have to reset your password, or you want to quickly make a change without navigating through the dashboard or starting a job. Furthermore, connecting to Rosie from VSCode gives you all the benefits of VSCode with all the computing power of Rosie!
