This is a great way to quickly determine if the article is right for you, and our goal as student writers is to provide you with resources we believe are extremely credible, rather than just our own opinions.</p>

## What is the Learning Tree?
The Learning Tree is a visual representation of the world of AI, built by pulling from reliable sources students before you have identified as useful and structure in an easy-to-visualize way. This tree is a great way to understand the different branches of AI and how they all connect to one another. While we are planning to continually update the tree, you can be sure that the videos/artciles we've linked to are some of the best resources available on the topics, rather than articles that we've written relative beginners to the space of AI as we are all collectively pursuing our degrees at MSOE.

Content that is exclusive to the learning tree, which won't be linked to separate articles, include information specific to MSOE. You can expect this to be information about the club itself (such as this article!), information about ROSIE, mentioning classes, and even workshops developed by AI-Club or our NVIDIA partners.

By working your way through the tree, you'll be able to understand the different branches of AI and how they all connect to one another. This will help you understand the different pathways you can take in AI, and ultimately help you decide what you want to focus on in the field. Feel free to reference these resources at your own pace, and don't be afraid to reach out to AI-Club if you have any questions!


## What is AI-Club (MAIC)?
The MSOE Artificial Intelligence Club (MAIC) is a student organization that focuses on "demystifying AI for everyone", ultimately providing a network of students who are interested in AI and are motivated to learn more about it. We do this through both high-level and low-level learning opportunities:<br/>

### High-Level Learning
"High-level" learning opportunities are those that are more general and are easy to pick up. This primarily includes bi-weekly speaker events which we host in the Direct Supply ITC Great Hall on Thursdays from 6:30-7:30pm, bringing in industry professionals who are leaders in their field to talk about AI and ultimately *WHY* it's important to learn!

### Low-Level Learning
"Low-level" learning opporunities are hands-on projects -- we pride ourselves on providing these opportunities for ALL students through a student mentorship evironment. Whether you're a freshman or a senior, we have a project for you to work on and learn from on a team of motivated students, guided by a student mentor who has experience in the field. Possible project pathways are as follows:
* **Innovation Labs:** Recommended for people getting started with AI, these projects are in a team of 8-12 students (again, with a student mentor providing guidance and direction) and are focused on a problem provided by an industry sponsor. Across 2 months, you'll work on a solution for the partner's problem in a hackathon with a $5000 prize pool, presenting your solution to the sponsor at the end and ultimately achieving an AMAZING portfolio piece where you worked on a real-world problem.
* **Research Groups:** Recommend for people who have worked on a team before, these projects are in a team of 4-6 students (again, with a student mentor providing guidance and direction) and are focused on developing a NOVEL solution to a problem in the field of AI. Across 6 months, you'll work on writing a research paper to be submitted to a conference/competition, presenting your solution and ultimately creating an AMAZING portfolio piece where you are an author of a published paper in a novel space of AI. AI-Club will help you get your paper published and will provide funding for the conference/competition you submit to.
