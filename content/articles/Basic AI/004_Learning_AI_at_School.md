## Why Should I Learn AI with AI-Club?
After reading a few of our articles, you may be asking "what can I learn from AI-Club if I'm already going to learn it in school?" The answer is simple: AI-Club provides a unique learning experience that is meant to supplement your traditional classroom experience.

If you are a student who is just starting to learn about AI, AI-Club is a great way to get hands-on experience with real-world projects and build a network of motivated students who are interested in AI. By participating in AI-Club activities, you will be able to learn from industry professionals, work on projects that are relevant to the field, and ultimately build a strong portfolio of work that will help you stand out to employers which isn't possible in a classroom setting which focuses on building foundational knowledge over the course of years.

In fact, by participating in AI-Club, you will be able to learn a lot in a short amount of time, and your coursework will provide you the foundational knowledge needed to fill any gaps you missed. This ultimately develops you into a well-rounded AI professional with a strong portfolio of real-world projects that opens doors for you to more coveted internships as well as aids with your future AI-focused classwork typically only seen by upperclassmen.

Referencing the image below, this is our learning philosophy: we believe by providing students a pathway for "diving into the deep end of AI", motivated students will be able to learn incredibly complex topics in a short amount of time they would have otherwise waited years to see.
