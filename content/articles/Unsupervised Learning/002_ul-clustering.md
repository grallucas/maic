<p style='color: white; margin-top: 2px;'>"Clustering" is the most common unsupervised algorithm that most people think of. Like we discussed, that means it's able to achieve insights without data labeling -- though evaluating those results is often difficult. Clustering is a great tool to always have in your back pocket as someone involved with AI.</p>

Before getting to the below article which outlines 5 essential clustering algorithms, let's first understand what clustering is and why it's important in the world of AI.
<br/>
## What is Clustering?

Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm that groups data points together based on their similarities. The goal of clustering is to find patterns in the data that can help us understand the underlying structure of the data. Clustering is a powerful tool that can be used in a wide range of applications, such as customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and image processing.

## Why is Clustering Important?

Clustering is important because it allows us to discover hidden patterns in the data that may not be immediately apparent. By grouping similar data points together, we can gain insights into the structure of the data and identify relationships between different data points. Clustering can help us identify outliers, detect anomalies, and segment data into meaningful groups.

In the world of AI, clustering is a valuable tool that can be used to solve a wide range of problems. By understanding the different clustering algorithms and how they work, we can leverage the power of clustering to gain valuable insights from our data.
