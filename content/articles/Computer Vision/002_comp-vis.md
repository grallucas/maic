This resource discusses different techniques on how input images are manipulated to turn them into pixel and color data that a Computer Vision model is able to intake and interpret.  Some key takeaways from this are Uniform Aspect Ratio, Mean & Standard Deviation of Input Data, Image Normalization, and Dimensionality Reduction.
