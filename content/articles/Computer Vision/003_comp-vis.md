This resource provides great insight into the how a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) works by providing mutiple views for explaining how a CNN works, which is very useful for getting an understanding of how a CNN model works.  This article also discusses the different layers that make up the architecture for a CNN, explaining how they work and their function.
