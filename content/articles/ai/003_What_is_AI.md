## What is AI, ML, and DL?
**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the field of computer science that focuses on creating machines that can learn and make decisions. AI is a broad field that includes many different subfields, such as **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)**. Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on creating algorithms that can learn from data and make predictions. Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that focuses on creating algorithms that can learn from data and make predictions using neural networks.

Looking at the image below, you can see how AI, ML, and DL are related to each other, as well as the relative time period in which they were developed. AI is the oldest of the three, but also contains the other two as subset fields, with ML being developed in the 1980s (containing DL) and DL being developed in the 2010s.

## What is AI Used For?
AI is used in many different fields to solve a wide range of problems. Some common use-cases of AI include:
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** AI is used to analyze and understand human language, such as text and speech. This is used in applications like chatbots and voice assistants.
* **Computer Vision:** AI is used to analyze and understand images and videos. This is used in applications like facial recognition and self-driving cars.
* **Generative AI:** AI is used to generate new content, such as images, music, and text. This is used in applications like art generation and music composition.
* **Reinforcement Learning:** AI is used to learn how to make decisions by interacting with an environment. This is used in applications like game playing and robotics.
* **Time-Series Forecasting:** AI is used to predict future values based on historical data. This is used in applications like weather forecasting and stock market prediction.
* **Anomaly Detection:** AI is used to identify unusual patterns in data. This is used in applications like fraud detection and cybersecurity.

These are just a few examples of how AI is used in the real world. AI is a powerful tool that can be applied to many different problems, and it is constantly evolving as new techniques and technologies are developed. For each of these different areas, along with many more, we include them in the learning tree to help you understand the different branches of AI and how they all connect to one another.

## What is the History of AI?
AI has a long and storied history that dates back to the 1950s. The field has gone through many ups and downs over the years, with periods of rapid progress followed by periods of stagnation. Some key milestones in the history of AI include:
* **1950s:** The birth of AI as a field of study, with the development of the first AI programs and the proposal of the Turing Test.
    * **People to Know:** Alan Turing (Turing Test), John McCarthy (coined the term "Artificial Intelligence")
* **1960s:** The development of early AI systems, such as the General Problem Solver and the first expert systems.
    * **People to Know:** Herbert Simon (General Problem Solver), Edward Feigenbaum (expert systems)
* **1970s:** The first AI winter, a period of reduced funding and interest in AI research.
    * **People to Know:** Marvin Minsky (co-founder of MIT's AI Lab), Seymour Papert (co-developer of the Logo programming language)
* **1980s:** The development of Machine Learning as a subfield of AI, with the introduction of algorithms like the perceptron and backpropagation.
    * **People to Know:** Geoffrey Hinton (backpropagation), Yann LeCun (convolutional neural networks)
* **1990s:** The second AI winter, a period of reduced funding and interest in AI research following the failure of early AI systems to live up to their promises.
    * **People to Know:** Rodney Brooks (co-founder of iRobot), Judea Pearl (Bayesian networks)
* **2000s:** The resurgence of AI research, with the development of new techniques like deep learning and the rise of AI applications like self-driving cars and voice assistants.
    * **People to Know:** Andrew Ng (co-founder of Google Brain), Fei-Fei Li (ImageNet)
* **2010s:** The current era of AI, with rapid progress in areas like computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.
    * **People to Know:** Alex Krizhevsky (AlexNet), Andrej Karpathy (AI at Tesla), Sam Altman (OpenAI)

AI has come a long way since its inception, and it continues to evolve as new technologies and techniques are developed. By learning about the history of AI, you can gain a better understanding of how the field has developed over time and where it is headed in the future.
