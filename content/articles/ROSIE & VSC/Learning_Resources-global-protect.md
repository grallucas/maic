## Global Protect - Access Rosie from off campus

**Rosie can normally only be accessed from the schools network.**<br><br>
However, we can get around this through the use of a VPN!
The VPN MSOE uses is called Global Protect and can be downloaded from [here](https://vpn.msoe.edu/global-protect/getsoftwarepage.esp).
Choose the Windows 64bit download and follow the installation instructions

When you first open global protect, you will need to enter the address you wish to connect to at the bottom of the window.
For us, this is **vpn.msoe.edu**

When you hit connect you may be asked for your msoe credentials.
Afterwards your global protect window will say you are connected. Then you should be able to connect to the ROSIE portal from anywhere!
