<p style='color: white; margin-top: 2px;'>By reading this article, you will learn how to start using the campus supercomputer, ROSIE, which has over 64 petaflops of compute power to play with (your laptop might have around 3 teraflops). Regardless of your technical background, having access to this level of compute power can help you solve some of the world's most pressing problems while learning valuable skills along the way. </p>

## Introduction - What is cloud computing?
Welcome to the world of supercomputing! ROSIE is an awesome resource that gives students access to compute power they otherwise wouldn't have. But, before diving into how you can use this machine, we need to know: what is cloud computing, and how will we use it to access ROSIE?
 
Cloud computing can be described as using remote servers on the internet to store, manage, and process data instead of relying on your local machine. Think of it as borrowing someone else's computer but on a massive scale - you can access ROSIE from any place on campus (or anywhere using a VPN). Instead of borrowing just any old computer, however, you've gained access to a machine designed for speed, power, and efficiency. ROSIE is your personal cloud computing service, but turbocharged and tailored for heavy-duty tasks that require serious computational muscle.
 
So, whether you're working on complex research, developing next-gen AI, or just curious about what this supercomputer can do, this guide is here to show you the ropes. Ready to explore the limits of what’s possible? Let’s get started!



## Gaining Access

Only those who have reason to use ROSIE can get access to its resources. As an MAIC member, you are able to request access to ROSIE by filling out [this form](https://msoe.dev/#/requestaccess). Please fill out the form to the best of your ability. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to an eboard member. 

Towards the end of the form, there might be some questions that you might not know how to answer. Below are those questions and responses:

Question 4: Please describe why you are requesting access to Rosie. In this description, please include why Rosie is needed beyond what your campus-issued laptop provides.
Answer: AI-Club


Question 5: Please select all the tools you need to use for the request you are making.
Answer: Select All Boxes (except for the last one)


Question 6: If you plan to use GPUs, please describe what acceleration libraries you need.
Answer: tensorflow/keras


Question 7: How much storage do you require (list MB, GB, TB)?
Answer: 10GB


Question 8: Do you plan to use proprietary data with ROSIE?
Answer: Leave blank (unless you have proprietary data)



After requesting access you will likely get a response from Dr.Retert with instructions on logging in for the first time. If you are requesting access at the same time as many others, it might take a couple of days for a response.
