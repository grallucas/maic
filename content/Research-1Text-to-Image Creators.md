**Focused on generating images from text using attention-based model architecture.**<br/>
**Team Lead:** Nikhil Gajghate<br/>
**Year:** 2023-2024

Our goal is to create images from text using models that use an attention-based architecture. We want to investigate how these models function internally, so we analyze a Stable Diffusion model in detail. We also experiment with improving the model by training it on different data and measuring the results.
