Artificial Intelligence (AI) has repeatedly showcased remarkable capacity for revolutionalizing every industry and everyday life. It processes vast amounts of data for valuable insights, enhances productivity for a wide range of capabilities for automation, and refines decision-making by learning from patterns. It can break language barriers, facilitate academic and industry conversations, and provide precise diagnostics. <br/>

AI's continual evolution promises ongoing advancements that will redefine our current innovation boundaries -- and you are on the forefront of this wave of advancement with the potential of becoming a leading expert in this field!</br>

By completing this "Learning AI" series, you'll be capable of communicating with researchers and industry leaders about the AI-topics of today. Let's get started...<br/><br/>

**Warning: This article is still a work in progress -- we plan to complete this module before our first Introductory workshop on (9/7)**

## Why Do We (And Industry) Use Python?
Academic and industry researchers primarily use Python for AI development due to its numerous advantages:<br/>
- Simple syntax
- <a href = 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/libraries-in-python/#'>Extensive libraries</a>
- Widely adopted, lots of community support
- Easily implemented into other frameworks

Therefore, this is why we (and industry) use Python for AI-related topics. However, once you begin moving into industry, it's important to recognize Python is good for **experimental** systems. Once a system moves into production, you'll likely need to change your implementation to a more computationally-efficient language (see image below).

## Difference Between AI/ML/DL
Next, before diving into an overview of AI, you should understand the different between Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL).
We've built-out this graphic below (feel free to share around) to encapsulate these differences in a quick way.

*Basically, they're not necessarily compeltely different, it's just they represent varying aspects of this grand field of artificial intelligence.*<br/><br/>


## What Connects All of AI?
It's quite challenging to find a global similarity between all portions of a field as large as artificial intelligence. However, there is a "loss" associated with every AI network -- some learning methods may just rely on it more than others.

Look at the below image to visualize this "loss" process. This short gif is a visualization of an AI network learning. As the network gets closer to the bottom of the hill, it gets closer to an answer we want it to achieve. Therefore, "height" in this scenario is the "loss" or **difference between what the AI network achieved and what we wanted it to achieve**, and the other dimensions in this graphic are the weights/parameters the AI network can change to get to the bottom of the hill.

To recap, **all AI algorithms have the goal of reaching the bottom of hills like this!** We will go over the details of this "loss", as well as how the AI knows how to travel down it, in a later module.


## Different Types of Learning
When creating different machine learning algorithms, there are many different approaches to teaching an algorithm how to appropriately respond to a dataset. These approaches are key to understanding what algorithms would work best with your applications and can save you a lot of time in the long run. Below is a breakdown of the overall types of learning (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement), as well as different model types you could associate with each.<br/>

Do not worry about fully comprehending this chart now, this is just another graphic to show you the "breadth" that AI has on new algorithms.

## Conclusion
Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands as an unparalleled force, reshaping industries and daily life. From data-driven insights to automating tasks and informed decision-making, AI transcends barriers, amplifying communication and precision. As you embark on the "Learning AI" journey, grasp the pulse of this transformative wave. Python's versatility serves as the AI hub,  embracing Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). The common thread—a "loss function"—underpins AI, steering learning endeavors. Immerse yourself in this learning experience and become an AI expert in your field of choice!
