summary: Exploring using an LLM to play Town of Salem. After finding and making some adaptations to a computational model of the game, they are temporarily setting that aside in favor of a model where the moderator enters game state into an adapter or "bridge" responsible for talking to the LLM on behalf of the moderator. (The moderator would then talk to players on behalf of the LLM bridge).
