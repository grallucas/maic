**AI predicts IHC slides from H&E stains, enhancing medical diagnostics.**<br/>
**Team Lead:** Alex Moran<br/>
**Year:** 2023-2024

Working to generate IHC slides from H&E stains. IHC slides are used to detect specific proteins in tissue samples, while H&E stains are more common and cheaper. By using AI to predict IHC slides from H&E stains, the group hopes to lower the cost, false positives, and diagnosis time of tissue analysis, and increase the accuracy of protein detection.
