summary: Our group investigates how to use reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the performance of different restaurants in a simulation environment. We created and compared various RL agents that can control various factors of a restaurant, such as menu, pricing, and staffing. The agents learn from the feedback of the customers and the revenue of the restaurant, and aim to maximize the long-term profit by analyzing the effectiveness and robustness of the RL agents in adapting to different scenarios, such as changing customer preferences, demand fluctuations, and competition.Â
