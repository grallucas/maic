summary: We are doing reinforcement learning on function calling language/vision agents by calculating the trajectories of specific tasks. We then apply these tasks by having these agents be placed in a controlled environment, such as a simplified MineCraft engine, and allow it to make decisions based on what it sees to progress in the game.
