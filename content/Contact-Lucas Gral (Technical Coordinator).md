### Lead Workshop Developer & Coordinator

Hey! I'm Lucas Gral, and I'm a Senior majoring in Computer Science. I joined AI club because I was intrigued by the opportunity of gaining experience in AI through a research team. Outside of AI Club, you'll find me at Direct Supply as a data science intern. I also enjoy tinkering with Linux, programming language design, and making music.
