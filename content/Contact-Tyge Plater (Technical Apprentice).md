### Workshop Developer Apprentice

Hi!  My name is Tyge Plater, I am currently a Junior Software Engineering student here at MSOE.  I first joined AI club because I wanted to learn about the concepts of AI, and how they can be applied, in combination with software engineering, to solve real world problems â€“ which being on a research team has helped with.  Outside of AI Club, I am apart of Game Development Club where I work on Roblox Development, and I am working on a team to create a web application using Kotlin.  In my free time I like to snowboard, longboard, play video games, or watch Formula 1 and other motorsport series.
