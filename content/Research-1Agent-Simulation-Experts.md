**Simulating agents in interactive environments to study emergent properties and applications.**<br/>
**Team Lead:** Lucas Gral<br/>

Simulating human (and/or non-human) agents in an interactive environment to build upon a similar prior work (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf). In having agents powered by an LLM, we expect to see emergent social and physical properties of the environment as they interact with it. Our hope is that this agent-based approach can be applied to more problem domains than only the simulation of human communities.
