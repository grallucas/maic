### Workshop Developer

Hello! My name is Ella Bruce and I’m currently a junior Computer Engineering student. I joined AI Club as an opportunity to learn about the growing industry and to reach outside of my class material. It’s been an awesome way to connect with other students. I’m also working as a software intern for Astronautics and I enjoy knitting in my free-time.
