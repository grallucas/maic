### Overall Management of Events & Wider-Community Outreach

Hey! My name's Ben Paulson and I'm currently a Junior Computer Science student at MSOE. I joined AI Club to start learning AI concepts as fast as possible once I came to college -- and it has definetely paid off! The club has continued to grow and more students are learning about AI every day. Beyond AI-Club, I'm a data science intern at Direct Supply and I enjoy game development, making music, and 3D printing in my spare time.
