When talking about Artificial Intelligence (AI), it's important to recognize the innovations of today and tomorrow which are continually having an influence on the field. In fact, this philosophy is the basis of our AI-Club workshops: presenting the latest AI innovations of today so that you can build the best AI applications of tomorrow.<br/>

**Warning: This article is still a work in progress -- we plan to complete this module before our first Introductory workshop on (9/7)**

## AI of the Past
- **Inception (1943-1956)**
    - 1956 Dartmouth College conference showed successes with simple network architectures. John McCarthy dubbed "thinking machines" as "artificial intelligence". 
- **Early Enthusiasm (1952-1969)**
    - Started solving puzzles, math questions, IQ tests, and other simple games. Seen as indication of human-level intelligence.
- **The AI Winter (1969-2012)**
    - Over-hype of AI led to limitations becoming apparent. Publication of "Perceptrons" outlined all flaws of current ML techniques, halting development of new systems in hopes of reaching true AI.
- **Modern Hype (2012-Today)**
    - Hype from Alex Krizhevsky's AlexNet which introduced skip connections to appropriately propogate network memory through deep neural networks resulted in more compex findings possible from multi-layer perceptrons.


# AI of the Present
The present era is witnessing a renaissance in AI, driven by advancements in machine learning, data availability, and computational power. **Machine Learning**, a subset of AIâ€”has shown remarkable progress in tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing. **Deep Learning**, a specific approach within machine learning, has enabled computers to learn complex patterns from vast amounts of data.

One notable innovation is **Neural Networks**, which attempt to replicate the structure and functioning of the human brain's interconnected neurons. These networks have led to breakthroughs in tasks like image classification, language translation, and speech recognition. The rise of Big Data has provided AI systems with ample information to learn from, enhancing their accuracy and capabilities.

Additionally, **Reinforcement Learning** has enabled AI systems to learn through trial and error, often achieving superhuman performance in games and simulations. AI-powered virtual assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and chatbots have become integral parts of our daily lives, showcasing the progress in natural language understanding and generation.

# AI of the Future
The future of AI holds promises that are both exciting and thought-provoking. As AI continues to advance, it's poised to revolutionize industries such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. Autonomous Vehicles are becoming a reality, with AI systems driving cars safely and efficiently. In healthcare, AI aids in diagnosing diseases, designing treatment plans, and even drug discovery.

**Ethical considerations** are also gaining prominence as AI becomes more powerful. Discussions revolve around transparency, bias mitigation, and the impact of AI on jobs and society. Striking the right balance between innovation and responsibility is a critical challenge.

The concept of **General AI**, where machines possess human-like general intelligence, remains a long-term goal. While we may not have human-like AI in the immediate future, we can expect more specialized AI systems that excel in specific tasks.
