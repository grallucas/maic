### Workshop Developer Apprentice

Hi! My name is Aiden Miller, and I'm a Junior Computer Science student. I joined AI Club my freshman year and immediately was hooked, it's been a blast learning everything I can in that space. Outside of AI Club, I work at Direct Supply as a Data Science Intern, contribute towards Raider Robotics travel planning and enjoy being outside, playing TTRPGs, staying active and reading fantasy.
