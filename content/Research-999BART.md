**Members:** Mazen Hamid, Nikhil Gajghate, Bart Gebka, Matej Koncos, Justin Benning<br/>
**Year:** 2022-2023<br/>
**Problem:** Researching through the Academic Catalog is tedious when wanting to find information about the university​<br/>
**Approach:​** Using a transformer to “learn” the catalog and be able to answer questions about the university and courses​<br/>
**Progress:​** Currently working on a proof-of-concept LSTM model with the SQUAD dataset​<br/>
