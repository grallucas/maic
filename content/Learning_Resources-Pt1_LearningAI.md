Artificial Intelligence (AI) has repeatedly showcased remarkable capacity for revolutionalizing every industry and everyday life. It processes vast amounts of data for valuable insights, enhances productivity for a wide range of capabilities for automation, and refines decision-making by learning from patterns. It can break language barriers, facilitate academic and industry conversations, and provide precise diagnostics. <br/>

AI's continual evolution promises ongoing advancements that will redefine our current innovation boundaries -- and you are on the forefront of this wave of advancement with the potential of becoming a leading expert in this field!</br>

By completing this "Learning AI" series, you'll be capable of communicating with researchers and industry leaders about the AI-topics of today. Let's get started...<br/><br/>

## Why Do We (And Industry) Use Python?
Academic and industry researchers primarily use Python for AI development due to its numerous advantages:<br/>
- Simple syntax
- <a href = 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/libraries-in-python/#'>Extensive libraries</a>
- Widely adopted, lots of community support
- Easily implemented into other frameworks

Therefore, this is why we (and industry) use Python for AI-related topics. However, once you begin moving into industry, it's important to recognize Python is good for **experimental** systems. Once a system moves into production, you'll likely need to change your implementation to a more computationally-efficient language (see image below).

## Difference Between AI/ML/DL
Next, before diving into an overview of AI, you should understand the different between Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL).
We've built-out this graphic below (feel free to share around) to encapsulate these differences in a quick way.

*Basically, they're not necessarily compeltely different, it's just they represent varying aspects of this grand field of artificial intelligence.*<br/><br/>
