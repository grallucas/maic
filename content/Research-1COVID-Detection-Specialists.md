**Evaluating deep learning models for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images.**<br/>
**Team Lead:** Ted Colwell<br/>
**Year:** 2023-2024

Evaluate the performance of different deep learning models in detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. Through the use of a large and recent dataset of segmented lung images we evaluated two deep learning architectures: Resnet-50 and InceptionV3. Both models achieve high test accuracy, above 99%, suggesting that deep learning can be a useful tool for COVID-19 screening. We also look at some possible ways to improve the results, such as using different data processing techniques and model architectures.
