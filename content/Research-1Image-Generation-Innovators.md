**Investigating and enhancing attention-based image generation models.**<br/>
**Team Lead:** Ryan Kruk<br/>
**Year:** 2023-2024

Exploring attention-based image generation models that can transform plaintext descriptions into images. With a focus on looking into the individual mechanisms that make these models work we are taking a Stable Diffusion model and breaking it down to understand the processes that make it work. We then extend this past the base Stable Diffusion model by fine-tuning the model on new datasets and observing its impact.
