**Problem:​** Getting CT scans is expensive and exposes patients to significant levels of radiation​. This is especially problematic is patients have chronic conditions that require scans often​; however, Chest X-rays are one of the lowest radiation imaging forms available​. What if there was a way to create a more helpful view from just two chest X-rays?​<br/>
**Approach:​** We are planning on using a complex CNN with residual connections to create a 2D view to 3D view converter​. The 2D views will be created by using a CycleGAN style transfer to convert from Averaged CT scan views to X-ray style, and the main model will use 2D to 3D upscaling convolution layers​.<br/>
**Progress​** Currently finalizing publication and future work development around the use of a transformer model.<br/>
