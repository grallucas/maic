**Using reinforcement learning to guide language/vision agents in a simplified virtual environment.**<br/>
**Team Lead:** Cody Steinmetz<br/>

We are doing reinforcement learning on function calling language/vision agents by calculating the trajectories of specific tasks. We then apply these tasks by having these agents be placed in a controlled environment, such as a simplified MineCraft engine, and allow it to make decisions based on what it sees to progress in the game.
