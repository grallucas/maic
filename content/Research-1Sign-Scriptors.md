**The Sign Scripters are developing a model to convert sign language videos into text.**<br/>
**Team Lead:** Michael Conner<br/>
**Year:** 2023-2024

The Sign Scripters implemented a state of the art model for interpreting videos of sign language into text. Their approach is based on a variant of transformers called squeeze formers which utilize CNN's to create embeddings from picture data. The input data is gathered from google machine vision to create landmarks of coordinates of the different bones in the hands and face. They hope to adapt this work into an application to help with sign language education.
