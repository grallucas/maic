**Using AI models to forecast spikes in commodity food prices, aiding underdeveloped communities.**<br/>
**Team Lead:** Ben Paulson<br/>
**Year:** 2023-2024

Our project focuses on developing an AI model that can accurately predict spikes in commodity food prices, a critical tool for underdeveloped communities where the average person spends a significant portion of their income on food. In these areas, unexpected price increases can severely impact access to essential nutrition, sometimes pushing families towards food insecurity or starvation. Our solution aims to empower these communities with advanced notice of price changes, enabling them to make informed decisions about purchasing or storing food. Currently, we're in the process of refining our predictive model and developing an online warning system to improve upon the existing warning system on the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) website: https://www.fao.org/giews/food-prices/home/en/. This system will serve as a platform to disseminate our findings, offering timely alerts that could help mitigate the adverse effects of food price volatility. The ultimate goal is to create a more resilient and informed approach to managing food resources in vulnerable regions.
