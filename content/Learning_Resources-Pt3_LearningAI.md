When talking about Artificial Intelligence (AI), it's important to recognize the innovations of today and tomorrow which are continually having an influence on the field. In fact, this philosophy is the basis of our AI-Club workshops: presenting the latest AI innovations of today so that you can build the best AI applications of tomorrow.<br/>


## AI of the Past
- **Inception (1943-1956)**
    - 1956 Dartmouth College conference showed successes with simple network architectures. John McCarthy dubbed "thinking machines" as "artificial intelligence". 
- **Early Enthusiasm (1952-1969)**
    - Started solving puzzles, math questions, IQ tests, and other simple games. Seen as indication of human-level intelligence.
- **The AI Winter (1969-2012)**
    - Over-hype of AI led to limitations becoming apparent. Publication of "Perceptrons" outlined all flaws of current ML techniques, halting development of new systems in hopes of reaching true AI.
- **Modern Hype (2012-Today)**
    - Hype from Alex Krizhevsky's AlexNet which introduced skip connections to appropriately propogate network memory through deep neural networks resulted in more compex findings possible from multi-layer perceptrons.
