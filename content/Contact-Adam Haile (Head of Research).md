### Lead Researcher & Research Coordinator

Hello! I am Adam Haile, a current Computer Science sophomore. I joined the AI club to gain insight into this rapidly evolving world and to meet new friends with similar interests. Outside of the club I am a Data Science Intern with Direct Supply. I also enjoy self learning embedded systems, web design, game development, 3d printing, and teaching others.
