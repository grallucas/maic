### Campus-Community Outreach & Marketing

Hi! I am Thomas Benzshawel, and I am a junior Computer Science student. I joined AI Club to learn about new AI concepts to better stay up to date on new inovations. I am a part of Triangle Fraternity, and I work two jobs, one as an automation intern and one as a data scientist at Foley and Lardner.
