**Advancing the alignment of histology brain slices with MRI images using Homologous Point Transformer methodology.**<br/>
**Team Lead:** Bart Gebka<br/>
**Year:** 2023-2024

Advancing the project initially spearheaded by MSOE undergraduate researcher, Alex Ruchti. We are utilizing the Homologous Point Transformer methodology to align histology brain slices with their corresponding MRI brain slices. This approach was previously applied successfully to prostate registration.
