How does one actually _do_ AI? Explore the industry standard tool that we use at MAIC: Keras. Learn how to make a very simple network in Keras, and how we can run our network on Rosie as a "SLURM" job.

To get the workshop on Rosie:

- Make sure you're connected to the Global Protect VPN
- Download the zip file, extract the ipynb file
- Go to the [Rosie dashboard](https://dh-ood.hpc.msoe.edu/pun/sys/dashboard)
- Go to Files > Home Directory
- Navigate to where on your Rosie home directory you want to save the ipynb. I suggest navigating to Documents, then making a new directory ("New Dir" button) called "workshops" and going there.
- Click the "Upload" button, click the "Browse" button, and find the ipynb you extracted.
- It's now on Rosie. You can navigate to this file when you start a notebook.

How to start a notebook:

- Go to Interactive Apps > Jupyter Notebook - Containerized
- Set number of GPUs to 1, and number of hours to 1
- Launch job (big blue button)
- Once a new tab opens, navigate to the ipynb file you opened, and click it
- You are now running the notebook on Rosie.
