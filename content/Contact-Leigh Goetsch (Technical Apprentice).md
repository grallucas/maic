### Workshop Developer Apprentice

Hi! I am Leigh Goetsch, a junior studying computer science with a minor in computer engineering. I decided to join the AI club to gain a broader understanding of AI concepts prior to encountering them in my academic coursework, as well as to explore applications of these technologies through our research groups. Outside of AI club, I am the co-controls lead for MSOE's VEXU robotics team, Raider Robotics.
