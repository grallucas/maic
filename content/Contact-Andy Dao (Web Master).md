### Lead Website Developer & Maintainer

I am a sophomore Software Engineering student pursuing a Data Science minor. I joined AI Club to learn more about applying AI and AI concepts to keep up to date and apply it to my learning process. I am actively involved on campus in a variety of other organizations such as Triangle Fraternity, User Experience Club, Raider Robotics, and Mythos Eros and Echoes. I enjoy game development, music composition and improvisation, and website management.
