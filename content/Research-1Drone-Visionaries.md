**Integrating computer vision with drones for autonomous search and tracking applications.**<br/>
**Team Lead:** Aiden Holcombe<br/>
**Year:** 2023-2024

Our team is working on incorporating computer vision on a drone in order to assist in autonomous movement. We hope to apply this in both searching and tracking applications. Currently we are working on a tracking proof of concept, where we will have a drone be able to follow a soccer ball during a game.
