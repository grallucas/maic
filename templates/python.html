        <h2>Installing Python</h2>
        <p>
          Python is our programming language of choice for AI.<br/>
          If you haven't come across it yet, you will in your later classes but it's good to get a head start now.<br/>
          The first step is to install python, make sure you don't use the version from the windows store, it only causes problems.<br/>
          Make sure when you open the installer to check the "Add Python 3.x to PATH" box, and then click "Install Now"<br/><br/>
          <img src="../resources/images/add_python_to_path.png" width="30%"/><br/><br/>
          You can go <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="blank">here</a> for the latest python download.<br/>
          After installing you'll also want to hit the "Disable path length limit" button if it is shown.

        <h2>Installing Visual Studio Code</h2>
        <p>
            In your classes they might tell you to use PyCharm, but our tool of choice (outside of jupyterlab for Rosie) is VS Code.<br/>
            You can go <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="blank">here</a> for the latest VS Code download.<br/>
            After downloading, you'll want to install at least the two extensions Python and Jupyter.<br/>
            You can find them by opening the extensions tab on the left sidebar and they should be under the "Popular" submenu, or you can search for them.<br/><br/>

        <h2>Lets Learn Python!</h2>
        <p>
            We'll be seeing python in two types of files, the first have the .py extension, and the second has the .ipynb extension.<br/>
            The .py files are normal python files where you can just hit run and they'll run through.<br/>
            The .ipynb files are called jupyter notebooks, they allow you to run small sections of code one at a time and are good for data science research and workshops.<br/>
            We will mostly be using the later in AI club.<br/>
            To get started learning python, go ahead and open <a href="../resources/downloads/python_intro.ipynb" download target="_blank">this notebook</a> in VS Code!
