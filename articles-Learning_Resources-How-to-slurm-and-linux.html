            <h1>Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management - SLURM</h1>
            <p>Slurm is the tool MSOE uses to manage jobs on Rosie, we will use it to allocate resources and start / monitor our jobs</p>
            <h2>Connect to a Rosie Terminal</h2>
            <p>If you've already gone through the steps to get logged in to Rosie for the first time then this is familiar.
            Open up your terminal of choice and enter the following command changing username to your username:</p>
            <p>ssh username@dh-mgmt2.hpc.msoe.edu</p>
            <p>You'll be prompted for your password and then be greeted with the login text.
            Note that you will need to be on the school network, if you are not, open up globalprotect and connect to the VPN.</p>
            <h2>Useful SLURM Commands</h2>
            <h3>- squeue</h3>
            <p>This command will show details on all currently running jobs.
            This is useful for finding details on jobs you've started.
            To filter jobs to only your, you can add the following arguements to the command replacing username with your username.
            squeue -l -u username</p>
            <h3>- scancel <jobid></h3>
            <p>This will cancel a job, enter the command followed by the jobid as can be found with squeue </p>
            <h3>- sbatch script.sh</h3>
            <p>This will submit a batch script to be run. This is useful for creating job templates and submitting multiple jobs at once</p>
            <p>An example can be downloaded <a href="http://msoe-maic.com/data/downloads/sbatch.zip">here</a>.
            Unzip the folder and drop it's contents somewhere onto Rosie
            In a Rosie connected terminal, cd into the directory that you dropped the files
            Run the command sbatch batch.sh
            You'll notice that you not have a .out file with the name of your job id that has the output of the python file.
            You can view this file by running the command $ tail -f slurm-(job-id).out which will show the output in real time.
            You can also use the squeue command to see that your job is running</p>
